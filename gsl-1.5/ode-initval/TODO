* Add a higher level interface which accepts a 

start point, 
end point, 
result array (size N,  y0, y1, y2 ... ,y(N-1))
desired relative and absolute errors epsrel and epsabs

it should have its own workspace which is a wrapper around the
existing workspaces

* Implement other stepping methods from well-known packages such as
RKSUITE, etc

* Roundoff error needs to be taken into account to prevent the
step-size being made arbitrarily small
