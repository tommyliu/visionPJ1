Kadir/Brady Feature Detector (Scale Saliency) Version 1.5

To compile use the Makefile or type

mex -O -DFASTPLOG CalcEntropyScalesOpt.c Hists.c -output CalcScaleSaliency

For an example of how to use the binaries run GoSalScale at the matlab prompt. The output should be the same as image_0001_out.jpg.

1) CalcScaleSaliency 

This function finds the salient points in an image.

Usage:

Y=CalcScaleSaliency(uint8(double(Im)./div),StartScale,StopScale, Nbins, Sigma,AA);

Im : input image (can be 8-bit grey-level, 2D 8-bit e.g. UV, 3D 8-bit e.g. RGB)
Nbins : number of bins for histogram 
div : 256/NBINS
Sigma : sigma of kernel for Parzen estimator (set NBINS to 0)
StartScale : Minimum scale
StopScale : Maximum scale
AA : Use anti-aliased sampling for generating the histograms (see Kadir, Zisserman and Brady ECCV 2004).

Scale means the radius of the circle.  The function expects the image to be quantised to the number of bins specified.  To do that we just divide by 256/nbins.

The output, Y, is a list of points in the following format:

X Position
Y Position
Scale
Entropy (HD)
Inter-scale saliency (WD)
Scale Saliency (YD)

2) GreedyCluster

Usage :

C=GreedyCluster(Y,wt,yt)

Y : List of salient features from CalcScaleSaliency
wt : Threshold on inter-scale saliency (WD)
yt : Threshold on saliency (YD)

This, as its name implies, is a greedy clusterer which starts with the highest saliency feature and works down removing any features that are too `close' in x,y,s.  Here, close means within the support of the current feature i.e its diameter. Its written in matlab so can be modified easily.

GreedyCluster has two parameters : Yt a global saliency threshold and Wt a global inter-scale saliency threshold (set between 0 and 2).  Setting the later high forces the selection of features that are more scale-localised or isotropic.

The output, C, is a list of clustered salient regions in the same format as above.
